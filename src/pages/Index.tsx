  summary: `<b>1. Neil Bredhauer</b><br>The plant's nutrient analysis indicates optimal levels of <b>Phosphorus (P), Sulphur (S), Calcium (Ca), Magnesium (Mg), and Copper (Cu)</b>, with no deficiencies or excesses detected. However, there are excess levels of <b>Nitrogen (N), Potassium (K), Zinc (Zn), Iron (Fe), Boron (B), and Molybdenum (Mo)</b> present in the plant. Overall, the plant's nutritional status is well-balanced with room for adjustment in managing excess nutrients. We have found that it is remarkably productive to try to maintain "luxury levels" of 4 minerals on a leaf test (The Big four). "Luxury", refers to the top end of the acceptable range. The Big Four include <b>Calcium (Ca), Magnesium (Mg), Phosphorus (P), and Boron (B)</b>. Here, you are deficient in 0 of the nutrients of the big four. Your excess of <b>Nitrogen (N), Potassium (K), Zinc (Zn), Iron (Fe), Boron (B)</b> can shut down several nutrients. Your nutrient antagonism is summarized as following: Nitrogen (N) can shut down <b>Potassium (K), Copper (Cu), Boron (B)</b> Potassium (K) can shut down <b>Magnesium (Mg), Calcium (Ca), Boron (B), Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P)</b> Zinc (Zn) can shut down <b>Iron (Fe), Copper (Cu), Phosphorus (P)</b> Iron (Fe) can shut down <b>Manganese (Mn), Zinc (Zn), Copper (Cu), Phosphorus (P), Calcium (Ca)</b> Boron (B) can shut down <b>Nitrogen (N), Potassium (K), Calcium (Ca)</b> Balanced nutrition is key to optimal plant health—addressing these nutrient imbalances will help your crop reach its full potential.`,
